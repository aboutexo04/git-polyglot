### 1. Python Code
The following Python code calculates the sum. **Variable names should NOT be translated.**

```python
def calculate_total(price, tax_rate):
    # This is a comment inside code
    total = price * (1 + tax_rate)
    print(f"Total price is: {total}")
    return total
```

### 2. JSON Data

  "is_admin": false,
  "settings": {
    "theme": "dark_mode",
    "notifications": true
  }
